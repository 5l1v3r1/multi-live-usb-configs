Following config files specify a configuration layout that allows a user to put multiple live repositories on a single usb flashdrive.

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Create a partition on your flashdrive, mark it bootable.
2. If you want to use Hiren's boot cd, format it to fat32, otherwise you can go with ext2/ext3.
3. Install syslinux to the partition

syslinux -i /dev/xxx  (when using fat32)
OR 
extlinux -i /dev/xxx ( When using ext2/ext3 ) 

4. Copy over the config files and splash. You can test now the device, the menu should work but you won't be able to boot anything yet.
5. Copy over all .c32 files from your syslinux directory to the root of usb drive. 
Depending on the distribution they may be in /usr/share/syslinux or /usr/lib/syslinux.



HOW DO I PUT MY LIVE DISTRIBUTION FILES ON THE USB
--------------------------------------------------
First, you need to unpack the iso image of your livecd. You can use 7zip for that.

For instance, by running "7z x file.iso", or by mounting the iso image and copying out the files. Copying files out of the iso with mc often fails, producing 0 length files (KNOPPIX) or not opening the iso at all (system rescue cd).

Once you extract the contents of the iso image, check the .cfg file for that distribution for further instructions. For example, for Fedora read fedora.cfg file.



WHAT'S THAT UUID ? 
------------------
You might notice that some configuration files contain a phrase UUID=SOMEUUID . You will need to fix that manually.

First issue a command 'blkid' with your usb device plugged in to your computer. You should get something like this

(.....)
/dev/sdc1: UUID="D88E-7075" TYPE="vfat"

Where /dev/sdc1 is the usb device. So the UUID is D88E-7075 . Replace all occurences of SOMEUUID with that value in config files.


non-fat32 filesystems will have more complex UUID's. Don't worry about that, and proceed normally.

Example : 
/dev/sda2: LABEL="boot" UUID="e27288df-82eb-44b3-90d3-32ffd6f8c26b" TYPE="ext3"
